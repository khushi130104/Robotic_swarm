# Robotic_swarm
A project that aims to enable robots to interact with one another in a swarm uses radio frequency (RF) modules to connect two robots. The objective of this project is to construct a system that can serve as a foundation for the creation of a swarm of numerous robots that can cooperate to complete a job. Two robots—one main and one follower—RF transmitter and receiver modules, an Arduino board for programming, and two robots—one main and one follower—are needed for the system.
The primary robot performs a job and then uses the RF transmitter module to communicate with the following robot. The follower robot completes the same duty as the main robot after receiving the message using the RF receiver module. It is simple to change the programming for both robots to enable more complicated behaviours, including obstacle recognition and avoidance.
By adding more RF modules and altering the programming, this system—which is a straightforward and efficient means for robots to interact with one another—can be readily expanded to support more robots. Developers may build swarms of robots that can cooperate to complete challenging tasks using this method. Developers may start working on this project right away thanks to the readme file's comprehensive instructions on how to set up the system and create the code.
